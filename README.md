# Kalman-Filters-in-Microgrids

Kalman filter to estimate the PCC voltages of multiple DERs. 

A Microgrid incorporates multiple DERs and state estimation of voltages at PCC is essential in order to avoid voltage regulation problems. 
In this implementation, Consider a 3 input voltages and 3 sensors that sense the PCC voltages of the 3 DERs. 
The state estimation of these 3 states (voltages) is done with the help of a Kalman Filter.
